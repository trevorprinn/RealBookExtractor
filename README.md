RealBookExtractor
=================

This is a small program to help with the rather tedious task of getting pages from pdfs of the real books that you have bought into the MobileSheets Android app.

It combines two functions:

1. Extracting the pages from the pdf as picture files.
2. Displaying each song in turn and allowing the Artist, Title and set of pages making up the song to be entered, then moving them into a folder structure suitable for Batch Import into the MobileSheets Companion app.
